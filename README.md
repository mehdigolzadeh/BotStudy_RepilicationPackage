# BotStudy_RepilicationPackage

This repository is replication package of our study about identifying bots in social coding platforms. We proposed an approach, a classifier and tool to identify bots based on the similarity of their comments.

To avoid any conflict with GDPR regulations we have removed the "**account_comments.csv.gz**" dataset. Therefor only "**accounts.csv.gz**" is available and it is only possible to run "**Classification of accounts.ipynb**" and "**Evaluation of the classifier.ipynb**".

The "**prediction.csv.gz**" file contains the prediction of the model for the entire dataset.
